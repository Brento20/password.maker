## Future improvments.

1. Error messages; I still need to work out why I cant get the error message to work on alpha characters.
2. I also should work out how to get the upper/lower/special/number arrays that i defined with the var to actually push into the characterPool.
3. When the user selects no character sets it should hae an error message.
